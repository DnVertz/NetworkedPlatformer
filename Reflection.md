# Reflection

Over the course of the 2nd part of my Year 12 2021 SDD Major project I feel that I have developed as a programmer far beyond what I was before I started, where it would have taken me days to solve an issue or implement a feature it now takes me hours or even minutes to do the same thing.Ontop of this I believe I have completed a project of considerably larger scope compared to anything I have done before, furthermore I have completed it to the extent of which I set out to do in the first place even exceeding my inital expectations in certain areas through developin gthis game I have come to understand the complicated nature of networking, where I spent months to solve a lag issue that was plauging my game so that I could to see another person move on my screen has now progressed to a level where . where players can chat, attack each other, race through levels and even design their own levels, I as a developer can say that I am happy with what I have created and will hopefully be able to use this to my advantage in illustarting my skills a software developer such as with university entry schemes for example the one at UTS that requires you to submit one of your personal projects. Now onto the negatives as I developed my program further I started producing more and more ineffcient solutions as I looked for solutions to more and more complex problems as a result of this I feel that my program isnt as elegant as it could be and reading the main file is honestly makes my eyes sore, however considering that the scope of this project is much larger than what I have ever embarked upon before and the fact that I did complete that scope somewhat excuses this in my eyes atleast. With this experince by my side in the future I will likely be able to avoid this since I now know what causes a "bloated" program. 

In conculsion this major work has convinced me that a future in the software development space is one for me I have thourghly enjoyed the challenge I presented myself with and am elated that I was able to overcome it, of course some things need polish but once again considering the scope of my game and the time constraints as well as disruptions in the form covid-19 I hope I get a good mark for this!
