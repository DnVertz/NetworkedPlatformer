# Reflection

Over the course of the 2nd part of my Year 12 2021 SDD Major project I feel that I have developed as a programmer far beyond what I was before I started, where it would have taken me days to solve an issue or implement a feature it now takes me hours or even minutes to do the same thing.Ontop of this I believe I have completed a project of considerably larger scope compared to anything I have done before, furthermore I have completed it to the extent of which I set out to do in the first place even exceeding my inital expectations in certain areas. Where the project began as a simple block jumping on a screen it has progressed to a full on multiplayer game where players can chat, attack each other, race through levels and even design their own levels, I as a developer can say that I am happy with what I have created and will hopefully be able to use this to my advantage in illustarting my skills a software developer such as with university entry schemes for examplethe one at UTS that requires you to submit one of your personal projects.
