Comments on display_text algorithim:

The algorithim is very compact, easy to understand and completes its purpose without issue however `display_text = display_text + l` could be replaced with `display_text += l` increasing its compactness!

Comments on the win/loss algorithim:

Like the previous algorithim it is also very compact, easy to understand and completes its purpose however I believe a function that scales the amount of lives with the length of the word is needed furthermore the selection of words is quite small and predictable and finally the output messages are a little too cheery for "hangman_howse.py" though I do believe the comments mend this.
